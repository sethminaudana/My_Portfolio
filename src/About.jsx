            On the frontend, I specialize in building engaging and responsive user interfaces using modern JavaScript frameworks like React.

            My interests also extend to the backend, where I have worked with technologies like Node.js, Express.js, SpringBoot and ASP.NET to build robust and scalable 
            server-side applications and APIs. I am also familiar with Databases like MySQL, MsSQL, Oracle and MongoDB.
